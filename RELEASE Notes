- 0.1.09 - ``Run Step 2 if upgrading from v0.1.7 or earlier``Added code to allow you to delete 
  'Ghost' nodes. - A 'Ghost' IP is one from a device where you change it's original IP address
  after it has been discovered. Also added some color to the display.

- 0.1.08a - ``Run Step 2 if upgrading from v0.1.7 or earlier``found a small bug that wouldn't 
  let you link to the latest Tasmota release. Also slipped in code to subtract 100 from the

- 0.1.04 - ``Run Step 2`` made a change to drop/create tables instead of 
  deleting the DB's file and recreating the tables.
